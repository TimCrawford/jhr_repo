<p><strong>Lutezine to Lute News 122 (July 2017): More versions of Daniel Bacheler pavans &amp; John Dowland's Lachrimae - settings of Squires galliard, Half Hanniken, Jog On/Hanskin, Up tails all &amp; What you please/ Tres choses &amp; Albert de Rippe part 14: Fantasie 1</strong></p><p><strong>More versions of Daniel Bacheler pavans</strong></p><p>One version each of Daniel Bacheler's pavans DB6-9 &amp; 16-19 were edited in <em>Lute News </em>122.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></sup> Five of them, DB6-9 &amp; 19, are unique to a single source, and the additional versions of DB16-18 are edited here with a commentary for all versions at the end of this <em>Lutezine</em>. In addition, although DB8 is unique to the Cherbury lute book, it was later annotated in a different hand (thought to be Bacheler himself) adding more dotted rhythms and completely replacing the division to the last strain. The annotated version is in <em>Lute News</em> 122 and the original is here for comparison. The two versions of DB16, one in Robert Dowland's <em>Varietie</em> in <em>Lute News</em> and the other in Holmes' Nn.6.36 here, both use a 7th course in F and are nearly identical with just a few significant minor variants in figuration. DB17 is also known from two sources, one in Nn.6.36 in <em>Lute News</em> and the other in the Herbert lute book here. Both use a 7th course in F and are nearly identical and accurately copied with about 20 apparent minor errors, and half a bar missing in the division to the A strain in both. The version in Herbert has not been annotated by the later scribe, who instead crossed out all the tablature. Four versions of DB18 all using a 7th course in F are known. The version from Pickeringe was in <em>Lute News</em>, and the closely concordant version in Herbert and the two in continental prints are here. The later scribe of Herbert made eight annotations (incorporated here) mostly changing the original readings to match the version in Pickeringe (details in commentary). The two versions in continental prints of Fuhrmann published in Nürnberg in 1615 and Mylius published in Frankfurt in 1622 are barred in 4 rather than 2 minims and surprisingly are closely concordant with the versions in English sources, once the twenty five or so apparent errors and omission of a half bar in the C strain in Fuhrmann, and about twenty largely different errors in Mylius are corrected.</p><p><strong>DB8b.</strong> GB-Cfm Mus.689, ff. 52v-53r <em>Pauana mr Daniel </em>- original	pp. 6-7</p><p><strong>DB16b. </strong>GB-Cu Nn.6.36, ff. 11v-12r <em>Mr D B.

However, the title <em>halfe haniking</em> is in the list of dance tunes from the 1590s that were used at Lleweni Hall, home of the courtier John Salusbury (c.1566-1612).<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Even earlier, it may be the same dance tune as <em>Hankin boby</em> referred to in Nicholas Udall's (c.1507-1556) play <em>Thersites</em> from 1537 (alternatively it could instead be the tune <em>Hanskin</em>, see below).<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The later section of the Board lute book, dated c.1630, includes a setting titled <em>half hanniken</em> for lute and two other settings are called <em>Courente</em> in a Bavarian manuscript from c.1640-5. All three are in the so-called English Gautier transitional tuning, which transcribed well into vieil ton (HH1-3). Playford included the dance tune as <em>Halfe Hannikin</em> in the first edition of <em>The Dancing Master</em> in 1651, introducing a variant B strain in the 4th edition, arranged for lute here. Two mid seventeenth century cittern manuscripts also include the same tune and title. It may also be the same as the country dance <em>Huff Hamukin</em> referred to in Sir Henry Herbert's office book of revels and plays performed at Whitehall at Christmas 1622/3.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p><p><strong>HH1i. </strong>GB-Lam 603 (Board), f. 38r<em> half hanniken</em> - edeff <sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup>	p. 22</p><p><strong>HH1ii. </strong>GB-Lam 603, f. 38r<em> half hanniken</em> - trans. to vieil ton	23</p><p><strong>HH2i.</strong> D-DO 1214, f. 7r <em>Courente</em> - lute tuned edeff	22</p><p><strong>HH2ii.</strong> D-DO 1214, f. 7r <em>Courente</em> - trans for vieil ton	23</p><p><strong>HH3i.</strong> D-DO 1214, f. 19r <em>Cour:</em> - lute tuned edeff	22</p><p><strong>HH3ii.</strong> D-DO 1214, f. 19r <em>Cour:</em> - trans for vieil ton	23</p><p><strong>HH4. </strong>Playford <em>The Dancing Master</em> 1651 &amp; 1670, p. 43 <em>Halfe Hannikin</em></p><p><em>	</em> - arranged from violin with 2 versions of B strain	53</p><p><strong>HH5. </strong>US-CA Mus.182 (Ridout), f. 66v <em>Halfe Hannikinge </em>- cittern	55</p><p><strong>HH6. </strong>US-CA Mus.179 (Boteler), f. 24r <em>half hannikin </em>- cittern	61</p><p>A dance tune called <em>Jog on</em> in Playford's <em>The Dancing Master</em> (arranged for lute as H2 here), is to a song found in Shakespeare's play <em>The Winter's Tale</em>, first performed 1611, at the end of Act iv, Scene 3, when Autolycus sings 'Jog on, jog on the foot path-way, And merrily hen't the stile-a; Your merry heart goes all the day Your sad tires in a mile-a'. This is the first of three verses of a song also found in <em>The Antidote against Melancholy</em> of 1661,<sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup> and the same text with the music of <em>Jog on </em>is in John Hilton's <em>Catch that Catch Can</em> 1667, p. 85.<sup><a href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup> The text of a ballad 'An old song on the Spanish Armado' beginning, 'Some years of late, in eighty-eight As I doe well remember' is found in Archie Armstrong's <em>Banquet of Jests</em> 1640,<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and several other books of verse without music later in the seventeenth century, and the same text titled 'Sir Francis Drake: Or, Eighty Eight' is set to the tune <em>Jog on</em> in Thomas D'Urphey's <em>Pills to Purge Melancholy</em> IV 1719, p. 37.<sup><a href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11">[11]</a></sup> With the alternative name<em> Eighty Eight</em>, the same tune was used for a number of other songs including Walter Pope's 'The Catholick Ballad: or an invitation to Popery, Upon considerable Grounds and Reasons. To the Tune of 88' beginning 'Since Pop'ry of late is so much in debate, And great strivings have been to restore it' (EBBA ID 36152; 36228; 34993 - includes music; 33693 1653-1681?; 30025 - includes music, 1689; 34994; and Bod490; Bod23319 - includes music; Bod10915 - Roud30468 &amp; 23228 - includes music, 1678; Bod542 - includes music, 1679; Bod5185 &amp; Bod5186 1674), as well as the related ballads, 'Reflections upon The Catholick Ballad' (EBBA 33688, 1675) and 'Room for a Ballad, or, A Ballad for Rome being A Continuation of the Catholick Ballad inviting to Popery (EBBA 32606, 32740, 1670-1708?). 'The Catholick Ballad' is also found in <em>Pills to purge Melancholy</em>, IV 1719, pp. 32-34. </p><p><em>Jog on</em> is the same tune as a keyboard setting by Richard Farnaby in the Fitzwilliam virginal book (GB-Cfm 168, pp. 416-418) titled <em>Hanskin</em>, which is the name of the tune in several Dutch lute books (H1, H3-5), and is also used in close to a hundred songs in Dutch song books.<sup><a href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12">[12]</a></sup> No ballad texts for Hanskin are known, and the tune is likely to have originated on the continent.<sup><a href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p><p><strong>H1. </strong>NL-Lu 1666, f. 435r <em>Courante van Hansken</em> [in G]/untitled [in F]	p. 53</p><p><strong>H2. </strong>Playford <em>The Dancing Master</em> 1651, p. 45 <em>Jog on</em> - arr. from violin	63</p><p><strong>H3. </strong>Hove <em>Florida</em> 1601, f. 110r <em>Hansken is so fraeyen </em></p><p><em>	</em>[index: <em>Hansken is so fraeyen gesel</em>]	70</p><p><strong>H4. </strong>NL-Lu 1666 (Thysius), f. 431r <em>Courante</em> (quotes the tune)	70</p><p><strong>H5. </strong>Adriaenssen <em>Novum Pratum Musicum</em> 1592, f. 82r <em>Courante</em>	71</p><p><strong>What you please - Tres choses</strong></p><p><em>What you please</em> is the title of a tune found in Playford's <em>Dancing Master </em>1651 and Walsh's <em>Compleat Country Dancing Master </em>1718 (arranged for lute here as W1) and <em>Musick's Delight on the Cithren </em>1666 (W2). The use of the tune in ballads is ambiguous, because no ballad text with this title is known and it is not always clear whether 'what you please' is used as a specific tune title or as a figurative expression.<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> For example, a ballad 'A new game at cards' was licensed with the Stationers Company in 1656,<sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> presumably referring to the broadside ballad 'A New game at Cards or, The three Nimble Shuffling Cheaters. To a pleasant new tune, Or, what you please' beginning 'You Gallants all that love to play, At Cards to pass the time away' (EBBA<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> ID31796 and Bod664<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> - Roud V4233). The pleasant new tune is a different tune titled <em>A new game at cards</em> identified in other sources,<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> and <em>what you please</em> could be either an alternative tune or a direction to pick a tune of your choice. Also see the equally ambiguous title of the song <em>seign<sup>r</sup> Baptist what you please you always cry, what you please I still reply</em> in GB-Lbl Add.63852 (Boynton), ff. 73v-73r. A different tune is inscribed <em>What you please</em> in Lady Elizabeth Cromwell's guitar book from the 1680s, transcribed for lute here as W3.</p><p>	The tune Playford and Walsh call <em>What you please</em> may have been known much earlier if John Ward was correct in identifying <em>What you please</em> as the ground to the first part of the medley <em>Tres choses</em>: the anonymous bandora solo in William Barley's <em>New Booke of Tabliture</em> of 1596, and a different bandora setting attributed to Anthony Holborne in Mathew Holmes' first lute book and different again to the anonymous solo cittern setting, all three also from the 1590s. The title translates as 'three things', the other two things/grounds being the passamezo antico in the second part and the romanesca in the third part.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup></sup> However, Ward does not elaborate on the details of his identification, and it is a puzzle given that the melody in Playford is not clearly present in any of the three distinct settings of <em>Tres choses</em>, also the ground of the first strain does not fit the tune, and a setting of the tune complete with harmony does not seem to have survived. Nevertheless, the versions of <em>Tres choses</em> are reproduced here (W4-5), as it was a good opportunity not only to include tablature for the cittern and two bandora settings but was also a chance to transcribe the two bandora settings for lute as no original lute solo of this medley is known. The setting in Barley needed some reconstruction and seems to be lacking the second half of the first strain compared to its division, restored here by repeating bars 25-32.</p><p><strong>W1. </strong>Walsh 1718 I, no. 99 <em>What you Please</em> - arr. from violin melody	p. 20</p><p>	= Playford <em>The Dancing Master </em>1665, p. 113<em> What you please</em> - violin</p><p><strong>W2. </strong>Playford <em>Musick's Delight on the Cithren </em>1666, sig.

To the Tune of, Up tayles all' beginning 'Come lets take the Rump' (Bod24377 Roud V28082, 1660), and the second 'A vindication of the Rump: or The Rump advanc'd, To the Tune of, Up tails all' beginning 'Full many a ballad hath been penn'd' (Bod584 Roud V11285, <em>c.</em>1659). Also a song beginning 'Fly merry News among the Crews' has the refrain 'To/At up-tails all' in Thomas D'Urphey's <em>Pills to Purge Melancholy</em> IV 1719,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23">[23]</a></sup></sup> pp. 176-178, but is in fact headed 'The Friar and the Nun' with music for the tune of that name<em> </em>(also edited in <em>Lute News</em> 122 and here), which Chappell suggested is a printers error and the text is therefore likely to be a later ballad to the tune <em>Up tails all</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24">[24]</a></sup> 'Up tails all' is also quoted as a dance or song in a number of plays and poems, usually in the context of sexual inuendo: Thomas Dekker's play <em>The Shoemakers Holiday</em> 1607 (Act II scene i line 63),<sup><a href="#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25">[25]</a></sup> in the line of <em>Sybil the Maid</em>: 'Faith, then haue at up tailes all. Ile go Iiggy-Ioggy to London, and be here in a trice, yong mistris' (for the other tune <em>Jiggy Joggy</em> see below). Also Sharpham's play <em>The Fleire </em>1607 (Act III scene i)<sup><a href="#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26">[26]</a></sup> includes the lines <em>Knight</em>: 'Shees wondrous musicall too.' <em>Fleire</em>: 'Verie true, she euerie day sings Iohn for the King, and at Vp tailes all, shees perfect.' <em>Knight</em>. 'Be these good tunes Fleir?' <em>Fleire</em>: 'Excellent, excellent sir, farre better then your Scottish Iigges.' Then in Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's play <em>The Coxcomb</em> performed <em>c.</em>1608-1610 (Act I scene i)<sup><a href="#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27">[27]</a></sup> is found the lines <em>Richardo.</em> 'No more I will not, Boy, lay me down, and rowle me to a Whore.' <em>... Silvio.</em> 'Then set your foot to my foot, and up tailes all.' <em>Viola.</em> 'That is <em>Richardo</em>, what a noise they make!', and in John Vanburgh's play <em>The Provoked Wife</em> 1697 (Act V scene 1)<sup><a href="#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28">[28]</a></sup> are the lines <em>Madem</em>: 'Why vat be the matter?' <em>Razor</em>: 'The matter? - why, uptails all's the matter.' Also, a poem 'Up tailes all' beginning 'Begin with a kiss' and ending 'For love he doth call /For his Uptailes all; /And that's the part to be acted.' is included in Robert Herrick's <em>Hesperides</em> 1648.<sup><a href="#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29">[29]</a></sup> Also, Chappell (PMOT), <em>op. cit.</em>, p. 149 refers to an allusion to <em>up tails all</em> in Ben Johnson's play <em>Every man out of his humour</em> published in 1600, but a specific mention of 'up tails all' was not found.<sup><a href="#footnote-30" id="footnote-ref-30">[30]</a></sup></p><p>A tune called <em>Jiggy-Joggy</em>, another sexual inuendo implied,<em> </em>is mentioned in the same quote as Up tails all in Thomas Dekker's play <em>The Shoemakers Holiday</em> 1607 (see above), and the only known version is reproduced here (J1). The Shirburn Ballads (1585-1616)<sup><a href="#footnote-31" id="footnote-ref-31">[31]</a></sup> include a ballad headed 'My heart is in pain my body within. The second part of Jeamye. To the tune of Gigg-a-gogge, or Woddycocke'<sup><a href="#footnote-32" id="footnote-ref-32">[32]</a></sup> beginning 'My hart is impure my body within'. As the text fits the tune here, then <em>Gigg-a-gogge</em> may be a variant of the tune name <em>Jiggy-Joggy</em>. Another ballad, printed as a Broadside c.1663-74, 'A Job for a Ioyner or A good Workman well imploy'd, This Maid must have a Workman come in hast Because she could not live no longer chast, and John the Joyner is the Man must do, Her Job and make the bed go Jigg a Jog goo' is to the 'Tune of, Over the water, fain I would pass, or Jig a Jog-goo &amp;c' beginning 'Come and attend young Virgins all' (Bod882 Roud V7460). Again the text fits the tune here so <em>Jig a Jog-goo</em> seems to be another variant name for the same tune.<sup><a href="#footnote-33" id="footnote-ref-33">[33]</a></sup></p><p>[Additional: Mike Beauvois 19/8/17 informed me it is the same tune as Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green in LN117]</p><p><strong>U1.</strong> GB-Cu Nn.6.36, f. 10v untitled<sup><a href="#footnote-34" id="footnote-ref-34">[34]</a></sup>	pp. 24-25</p><p><strong>U2.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.9.33, f. 95v untitled<sup><a href="#footnote-35" id="footnote-ref-35">[35]</a></sup>	25</p><p><strong>U3.</strong> GB-Lbl Eg.2046, f. 34r <em>A Toye</em>	25</p><p><strong>U4. </strong>Playford <em>Dancing Master</em> 1651, p. 97 <em>Up tailes all</em> - arr. from violin	52</p><p>	GB-Cfm 168, pp. 352-355 <em>Up T</em>[ails]<em>. all 32 Giles Farnaby</em> - keyboard</p><p><strong>J1. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.9.33, f. 77r <em>Jiggy Joggy</em> <sup><a href="#footnote-36" id="footnote-ref-36">[36]</a></sup>	5</p><p><strong>Three sheep skins &amp; Friar and the nun - continued</strong></p><p>Three versions of each of these two ballad tunes were in the supplement to <em>Lute News</em>, and two more of each are included here - a lute arrangement of a violin tune and a duet for two citterns in unison of both tunes.<sup><a href="#footnote-37" id="footnote-ref-37">[37]</a></sup> </p><p>Four appendices are added as page fillers, App 1. an untitled country dance tune in English Gauthier tuning also transcribed for vieil ton, and App 2. a ballad or dance tune with an obscure title, neither known from elsewhere.

The other nine concordant versions of the pavan from English sources are all reproduced here. All the staves have been lined up for comparison (hence some staves are cramped or spaced out in places), and all editorial changes are listed in the commentary at the end of this <em>Lutezine</em> (and most changes are in grey in the tablature). Additional concordant versions are found in continental sources and will be edited together with the many cognates (in both English and continental sources) in later <em>Lute News</em> supplements and<em> Lutezines</em>. The diversity in notation and especially ornaments and fingering provide insight into a variety of original performance possibilities. It is interesting that Dowland seems to have sanctioned the version in Board that is heavily annotated with playing instructions as it is thought that the tenuto are added in his in own hand, presumably in the course of teaching Margaret himself.<sup><a href="#footnote-38" id="footnote-ref-38">[38]</a></sup> About half of the settings here are for a six-course lute, and a seventh or eighth course is required in JD15c, e, h, k &amp; l. The version in Barley (JD15i) is surprisingly accurate, apart from a few type-setting errors, given Dowland's probable criticism of it as 'false and imperfect';<sup><a href="#footnote-39" id="footnote-ref-39">[39]</a></sup> it also includes useful indications of tenuto, right hand fingering and ornaments, as well as significant variants. All versions adhere to the same structure of three strains and divisions of A16, B16 and C17 bars (A8, B8, and C8½ bars in JD15d, e &amp; f, barred in 4, the rest barred in 2 minims per bar). The aim was to present all the versions and not venture at this stage to describe and analyse all the differences. The Complete Dowland edition included the single version JD15f here, amended with quite a number of editorial changes including conflation from other versions (see commentary). Further discussion and comparison of sources can be found in an online study by Tim Crawford and Michael Gale.<sup><a href="#footnote-40" id="footnote-ref-40">[40]</a></sup> JD15m is a two-bar fragment, enough to see that it is quite different but is included here. Addenda to the versions in <em>Lute News </em>122: JD15a - change my error of a2 to a1 in bar 27/8; JD15c - bar 11/2 - a1a2 instead of a2a3; 21/8-11 - 4 quavers instead of semiquavers; 23/5-6 - 2 crotchets instead of quavers.</p><p>JD15a.

Four lute solos are known in English sources and thirteen in continental sources, only one of the latter retaining the original title (S13). The music of Squires Galliard was also arranged as a lute duet (S16), cittern solo (S21), and for mixed consort (cittern and bandora parts: S19, S20, S22) in sources from as early as the 1580s. The titles <em>My Lo</em>[rd]<em> Strange his galiarde</em> (S5)<em> </em>and <em>The Earl of Derbes galliard</em> (S21) both refer to Ferdinando Stanley (1559-1594), known as Baron Strange and then as the 5th Earl of Derby from 1593. He was the patron of a troupe of actors known as 'Lord Strange's Men' in the 1580s and from 1593 as 'The Earl of Derby's Men'. The same actors probably later joined other troupes of English players touring Northern Germany taking the music they knew with them, probably accounting for the transmission of Squires Galliard to the continent.<sup><a href="#footnote-42" id="footnote-ref-42">[42]</a></sup> Two settings are titled <em>Galliard Lacrym </em>and<em> Gaillarda Paduana Lachrymae</em> (S6 &amp; S8), suggesting it was paired with the Lachrymae pavan in performance. Five versions in three different keys found in the lute book of Michael Eysertt of Nürnberg call it <em>Galliarda Englessa</em>. Note the variety in figuration, particularly in the memorable third strain. </p><p>S1.

This fantasie is also known from versions in three manuscripts, of English, German and Italian provenance, and the five largely concordant sources vary considerably in details of figuration (summarised in the commentary at the end of this <em>Lutezine</em>). The version in Fezandat is reproduced here together with one of the manuscript versions that is considerably shortened from 467 to 368 bars, which seems to have been intentional rather than a copying error as the omissions appear seamless. Some of the most difficult passages are omitted and the short version is useful if time is limited (I took 13 minutes to play 1a and 9 minutes for 1b). Fezandat 1553 is identical to Fezandat 1552 except for including the a6 at 19/1. The version in Le Roy &amp; Ballard is nearly identical to Fezandat for all 467 bars, except for 35 minor differences. The version in Dc.5.125 is barred in 8 minims and includes 96 minor differences to Fezandat ending unfinished after 274 bars. The version in MS 266 is largely identical to Fezandat (including some of the same errors) with irregular barring, 53 minor differences with occasional lacunae where bars are added or omitted (for example, bars 42-56 are largely absent; bars 111-113 are different; and four bars are inserted instead of bar 67). An alternative final cadence is also substituted.<sup><a href="#footnote-47" id="footnote-ref-47">[47]</a></sup></p><p>For a superb live performance captured on camera, hear Nigel North play the longer version (nearly 9 minutes, he plays faster than I do) on Youtube,<sup><a href="#footnote-48" id="footnote-ref-48">[48]</a></sup> and imagine de Rippe playing it in the king's private chamber, that is for François I, his French employer for the period <em>c.</em>1528-1547.</p><p><strong>Rippe1a.</strong> Fezandet I 1552, ff. 1r-6r <em>Fantasie</em>. 	82-87</p><p>	[index: <em>Premiere fantasie. fueillet</em>]</p><p>	= Fezandat I 1553, ff. 1r-6r <em>Fantasie</em></p><p><strong>Rippe1b.</strong> S-Uu Vok.mus.hs.87, ff. 59v-60r <em>fantasia di messer alberto</em>	88-91</p><p>	Le Roy &amp; Ballard I 1562, ff. 2r-6v <em>Fantasie premiere</em> </p><p>	D-Mbs mus.266, ff. 68r-69r <em>Recercar Alberto de Ripe die 1. fantasia des ersten buchs</em>; GB-Eu Dc.5.125, ff. 90v-92v untitled</p><p>		<em>John H.
