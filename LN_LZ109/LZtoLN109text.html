Four anonymous lute settings and one for cittern are also found in English manuscripts (n<sup>o</sup> 1g,h,l,r),<sup><a href="#endnote-14" id="endnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> and although lute variations by Francis Cutting are not known, he quoted the tune in the first strain of a galliard (n<sup>o</sup> 1s, in G). Settings of <em>Go from my window</em> are also in two continental manuscripts, one statement of the tune in the lute book of Princess Elisabeth of Hessen (n<sup>o</sup> 1b) and four in different keys (in C/C/F/G - all the other lute settings including Dowland's are in F) on the same page of the lute book owned by Johann Thysius but copied by Adrian Smout beginning <em>c.</em>1590, the first titled <em>Comme gentijl heardma</em>n and the last <em>Goe frou my windou</em> (n<sup>o</sup> 1j,k,p,q).<sup><a href="#endnote-15" id="endnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup> The first of these titles accords with a song to the tune beginning <em>Come gentle heardman</em> found in GB-Lbl Add.15117 dated <em>c.</em>1614 (n<sup>o</sup> 1u, lute accompaniment in G).<sup><a href="#endnote-16" id="endnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> The tune is also used for eight songs to a variety of texts in Dutch song books,<sup><a href="#endnote-17" id="endnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> and is also similar to the first strain of a galliard called <em>La Matriciana</em> (n<sup>o</sup> 1t, in G) in a large manuscript anthology of Italian dances copied by none other than Vincenzo Galilei in 1584.<sup><a href="#endnote-18" id="endnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> Finally, n<sup>o</sup> 1n is a later variant violin melody in G from John Playford's <em>Dancing Master </em>harmonised for the lute here. The lute settings are for a 6-course lute except n<sup>o</sup> 1b,g,p use a 7th course tuned to F (assuming a lute in G), and n<sup>o</sup> 1d,f&amp;l a 7th in D (although 1d&amp;f only use it stopped on the 3rd fret as an F).<sup><a href="#endnote-19" id="endnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup></p><p>Loth to depart is a common title for any song sung or tune played on taking leave of friends,<sup><a href="#endnote-20" id="endnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> although all seven known settings for lute (including Dowland's) and one for bandora reproduced here use the same tune. Two other tunes are known, one to a canon by Thomas Ravenscroft in <em>Deuteromelia</em> of 1609 (melody arranged for lute as n<sup>o</sup> 2d, see facsimile on p. 3 here)<sup><a href="#endnote-21" id="endnote-ref-21">[21]</a></sup> and the other by Thomas Gregory for lyra viol (n<sup>o</sup> 2j).<sup><a href="#endnote-22" id="endnote-ref-22">[22]</a></sup> The title <em>Loth to depart</em> is included in a tune list without the music compiled in the 1590s at Lleweni Hall in Denbigh, North Wales,<sup><a href="#endnote-23" id="endnote-ref-23">[23]</a></sup> and Loth(e)/Loath to depart is a tune quoted or called for in a number of plays and printed broadsides from the late sixteenth and for much of the seventeenth centuries. Richard Edward's play <em>Damon and Pithias</em> from 1571 alludes to the tune in Damon's lines <em>Loth I am to departe, </em>[w]<em>ith sobbes my trembling tounge doth stay, / Oh Musicke, sounde my dolefull playntes when I am gone my way </em>(sig. E1v).<sup><a href="#endnote-24" id="endnote-ref-24">[24]</a></sup> Later references include Richard Tarlton's <em>Newes out of Purgatorie</em> published in 1590, in 'The tale of the two lovers of Pisa, and why they were whipped in Purgatory with nettles' is found the line <em>and so, with a Loath to depart, they took their leaves (</em>sig. G3v); a ballad called <em>London’s Loathe to depart</em> was published to mark the departure of the Earl of Essex to Ireland as commander of the invading British forces in 1599;<sup><a href="#endnote-25" id="endnote-ref-25">[25]</a></sup> the line <em>The old woman is loath to depart, she never sung other tune in her life</em> in Middleton, Massinger and Rowley's <em>The Old Law</em> published in 1656 (but probably performed as early as 1599);<sup><a href="#endnote-26" id="endnote-ref-26">[26]</a></sup> Beaumont and Fletcher's <em>Wit at Several Weapons</em> published in 1647 in which in act II scene 2 Pompey exits singing <em>Loath to depart</em>; and as late as 1661 in <em>Antidote to Melancholy</em> is found the line <em>Then Will and his sweethart did call for Loth to depart</em>.<sup><a href="#endnote-27" id="endnote-ref-27">[27]</a></sup> Two texts of a song called <em>loath to depart</em> but lacking the music are found in John Cotgrave's <em>Wit's Interpreter</em> of 1655, and although the words he prints do not fit the main tune here several extant variants of the text do.<sup><a href="#endnote-28" id="endnote-ref-28">[28]</a></sup> The jig <em>A proper new ballett, intituled Rowlands god Sonne, To the tune of loth to departe </em>from before 1592,<sup><a href="#endnote-29" id="endnote-ref-29">[29]</a></sup> does not specify which tune, but the text begins <em>Tell me Jhon why art thow soe sade, tell me Jhon, tell me Jhon, what iste will make thee glade</em>, which matches the title of two instrumental settings of the tune, one in the Thysius lute book (n<sup>o</sup> 2i) titled <em>Gailliarde Tell messon</em>, and the other a very similar bandora version (n<sup>o</sup> 2h) titled <em>Tell me John </em>(followed by <em>W.S.</em>, presumably the initials of the arranger<sup><a href="#endnote-30" id="endnote-ref-30">[30]</a></sup>). This might suggest that the tune intended in Rowland's Godson is the same as the one used in the majority of extant settings including the first section of the Tell me John versions, but it does not fit the words and John Ward wasn't convinced it was the same tune, saying that it 'has sometimes been mistaken for the ballad tune'.<sup><a href="#endnote-31" id="endnote-ref-31">[31]</a></sup></p><p>	<em>John H.
