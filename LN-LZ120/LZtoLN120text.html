<p><strong>Lutezine to Lute News 120 (December 2016): - Put on your smock and Whoop do me no harm - music by Hieronymus Wully - Mercury d'Orleans continued - John Dowland Battles continued - Monaca/Alemano settings &amp; Albert de Rippe part 12: Fantasie 3</strong></p><p><strong>Put on your smock / Pretty Nancy</strong></p><p><em>Put on your Smock a’ Monday</em> is one of ten dance tunes referred to in a passage in Thomas Heywood's <em>A Woman Killed with Kindness</em> of 1603.<sup><a href="#endnote-1" id="endnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It is also quoted in the anonymous play <em>The Pilgrimage to Parnassus</em> of 1599,<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-2" id="endnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup></sup> and in John Fletcher's <em>Lovers Cure or The Martial Maid</em>, revived in 1625.<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-3" id="endnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup></sup> No ballads of this name or that call for the tune are known, but it survives in instrumental settings for lute, cittern and mandore. It is also set as a dance tune for violin in John Playford's <em>The Dancing Master</em> from the 4th edition. One of the cittern settings is titled <em>Pret</em>(t)<em>y Nancy</em>, which may refer to the text of a now lost ballad sung to it, and the tune is used as the 'Stemme: I have a love so fair, so Constant firme and kinde' to the text beginning ''Drou-voedster van myn ieugd' in Jan Starter <em>Friesche Lusthof </em>1621, pp. 81-82.<sup><a href="#endnote-4" id="endnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Here are eight settings of this single strain 8-bar tune, one for lute, two for mandore (one in lute tuning and the other transcribed for lute), three for cittern, one for violin transcribed for lute, and the fragment in the Folger lute book which begins similarly.<sup><a href="#endnote-5" id="endnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p><p><strong>P1. </strong>GB-En Adv.5.2.18 (Straloch), p. 8 <em>Put on thy sark on Munday</em> <sup><a href="#endnote-6" id="endnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> 	p. 4</p><p><strong>P2.</strong> cf.

William Shakespeare quotes the tune in <em>The Winter's Tale</em> written <em>c.</em>1611:</p><p>Serv[ant]: '... he makes the maid to answer <em>Whoop, do me no harm, good man</em> - puts him off, slights him, with <em>Whoop, do me no harm, good man</em>'</p><p>Several other ballads from the early decades of the seventeenth century call for the tune, including 'A merry Ballad of a rich Maid' 'To the tune of, hoop doe me no harme good man' (EBBA 20114)<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-8" id="endnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> and 'The Golden Age, Or, An Age of plaine-dealing' 'To a pleasant new Court tune: Or, Whoope doe me no harme good man' (EBBA 20066), the latter also probably giving the name to the same tune as in 'Doctor Dogoods directions' 'To the tune of The Golden age' (EBBA30052), 'The Honest Age' 'To the tune of the Golden age' (EBBA 20068) and 'The wiving age' 'To the tune of the Golden age' (EBBA 20178). The latter in turn probably gave the tune another alternative name as in 'I tell you, John Jarret, you'l breake' 'To the tune of the wiving Age (EBBA 20075), 'The Cooper of Norfolke' 'To the tune of The wiving age (EBBA 20188, 20256, 30027, 31705, 32938, &amp; 32949), and 'The cunning Age' 'To the Tune of The Wiving Age' (EBBA 20194). The tune was probably also used for other related ballads such as 'The silver Age ... To a pleasant new Court tune (EBBA 20067) and 'The Cheating Age' 'To a pleasant new tune' (EBBA 20069). A song 'To ye tune of Whoope! doe me noe harme, good man' beginning 'There was an old lad, Rode on an old pad' is also included in Fry's <em>Pieces of Ancient Poetry</em> 1814, p. 21, purportedly from a mid seventeenth century manuscript of mainly Elizabethan poetry now not known. The tune title is also quoted in John Ford's play <em>The Fancies Chaste and Noble</em> published 1638,<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-9" id="endnote-ref-9">[9]</a></sup></sup> and in <em>The Famous History of Friar Bacon</em>, published in 1627 but possibly from as early as 1555.<sup><sup><a href="#endnote-10" id="endnote-ref-10">[10]</a></sup></sup> Also a ballad called <em>Of Johnny and Jinny</em> in John Ford's <em>Westmynster Drollery</em> of 1672, part II p. 72, with the refrain 'Whoop Jinny, come down to me' might have been sung to the same tune.

No ballads are known that call for the tune, but John Vowell alias Hoker (d.1575) <em>Life of Sir Peter Carew</em> includes 'Sir Peter Carew (1512-1575) having a pleasant voice, the king (Henry VIII) would often use him to sing with him certain songs they call Freemen Songs, as namely, <em>By the banke as I lay</em>, and <em>As I walked the wode so wylde</em>.'

Also here are additional versions of some of the others that are in English sources or are sufficiently different to warrant inclusion for comparison; some are in a different key (n<sup>o</sup> 21c &amp; 23b) or have divisions on the strains although not necessarily Mercure's own. Considering how accomplished and attractive much of Mercure's music is, it is surprising that little of it has been recorded.<sup><a href="#endnote-13" id="endnote-ref-13">[13]</a></sup> N<sup>o</sup> 24 commemorates the battle of Pavia (just south of Milan) from nearly a century earlier in 1525, when the army of Francis I of France was defeated by the Spanish army of the Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. The version of the prelude n<sup>o</sup> 24a in D-LEm II.6.23 is identical to Fuhrmann, and the one in Besard is concordant but attempts unsucessfully to arrange it in triple time. The shorter 80-bar version of n<sup>o</sup> 24b in Besard's <em>Thesaurus Harmonicus</em> of 1603 is more-or-less concordant with the first 80 of the 248 bars of the setting in Fuhrmann's <em>Testudo Gallo-Germanica</em> of 1615, and the first few bars are quoted in the otherwise different <em>Bataille </em>setting in the Schermar manuscript 133b.<sup><a href="#endnote-14" id="endnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> Two different cognate versions of n<sup>o</sup> 19 are included here, and one was probably arranged by Robert Ballard for his <em>Premier Livre </em>published in Paris probably in 1611 and arranged for lute from the music to the Ballet de M. le Dauphin performed for king Louis XIII on 28 February 1610. The version in <em>Lute News</em> titled <em>Balletto du Roÿ Mercurÿ</em> could indicate that Mercury does not refer to the composer but is an allusion to the god Mercury, and it seems unlikely that Mercure composed music for French court ballets and is not recorded as being employed in France. </p><p><strong>2a. </strong>*D-W Guelf. 18.8, ff. 114r-117r <em>Passo è mezzo 1. parte / 2<sup>a</sup> parte / 3<sup>a</sup> parte /quarta parte /5<sup>ta</sup> parte /6<sup>ta</sup> parte /7<sup>ma</sup> parte /8<sup>a</sup> parte /9<sup>a</sup> parte</em>	11-15</p><p><strong>2b. </strong>*D-W Guelf. 18.8, ff. 117r-118r <em>Gagliarda 1<sup>a</sup> parte /2<sup>a</sup> parte /3<sup>a</sup> parte /4<sup>ta</sup> parte /5<sup>ta</sup> parte</em>	16-17</p><p><strong>4(a) </strong>D-Hs ND VI 3238 (Schele), p. 16<em> Corante Mercurÿ</em>	<em>Lute News</em></p><p><strong>4b.</strong> GB-Cu Nn.6.36, f. 25v ii <em>Currant</em>	26</p><p>	GB-Cfm 689, f. 65r <em>Courante </em>[Ennemond?] <em>Gauthier</em> </p><p><strong>6(a). </strong>D-Mbs 21646 (Werl), f. 73v <em>Couranta 32</em>	<em>Lute News</em></p><p><strong>6b.</strong> GB-Lbl Add.38539 (ML), f. 17v <em>A Volte</em>	25</p><p>	D-B N 479, ff. 13v-14r <em>Courante</em></p><p>	D-Dl M 297, p. 113 untitled</p><p>	D-Hs ND VI 3238, p. 48 <em>Corante Mercurÿ</em></p><p>	D-Hs ND VI 3238, p. 87 iii <em>Courante</em></p><p>	GB-Cu Nn.6.36, f. 25v i <em>Currante</em></p><p>	GB-Lam 603, f. 43v untitled</p><p>	RUS-SPan O N° 124, f. 40r <em>Cor:</em></p><p>	Moy<em> Le Petit Boucquet</em> 1631, f. 15v <em>Courante par de moy</em></p><p><strong>12(a).</strong> Besard 1603, ff. 161v-162r <em>Volta eiusdem</em>	<em>Lute News</em></p><p><strong>12b.</strong> GB-Lbl 38539, f. 20r <em>A Volte</em>	26-27</p><p><strong>14(a).</strong> Fuhrmann 1615, p. 177 <em>Volte Mercurii.

Note the similarity of phrase in bar 5 of JD20e and bars 1 and 5 of JD40q. A version of <strong>JD20</strong> that uses a 7th course in F just once was in <em>Lute News</em> 120, and the other four lute versions, for 6-course lute, are edited here together with the orphan consort bandora part and a transcription for lute. The lute solo setting of <strong>JD39(a) </strong>in <em>Lute News</em> 120 also fits as a consort part with the recorder, cittern and bass viol parts in Mathew Holmes' consort books, and so the tablature for the cittern part is included here as <strong>JD39b</strong>. One of the versions of the battle galliard <strong>JD40</strong> was in <em>Lute News</em> 120, and all the other sixteen are edited here. The galliard has three strains of eight bars and these twenty-four bars are repeated in the form of variations. Six versions in English sources and the one in Fuhrmann have four variations and are closely concordant, apart from the varying degrees of added ornaments and right hand fingering indications that range from none to many. The position and frequency of ornaments and the fingering are worthy of more detailed study, which I have not attempted here. The settings in the Königsberg, Sampson and Board lute books are also concordant with the other English versions and have two, three and seven variations, respectively, the last in Board in the form of extended 10-bar A and B strains only. The lute part from Dowland's <em>Lachrimae</em> of 1604 and another six continental versions comprise just one statement of each of the three strains and the latter are quite diverse or corrupt in places and are presumably arrangements by others (the final version ascribed to Gregory), although they bear similarities to the lute part. All versions are in D except the last one is in C, and eight versions are for 7-course lute (all but one 7th in D), seven for 8-course (7th in F, 8th in D) and two for 9-course (7th in F, 8th in E and 9th in D, although not using the 8th course so that an 8th in D could be substituted for the 9th in D).</p><p><strong>JD20(a).</strong> NL-Lu 1666 (Thysius), f. 22r <em>Douwlantes Gailliarde</em>	<em>Lute News</em></p><p><strong>JD20b. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 7v <em>Dowlands Galliard</em> - DowlandCLM 20	32</p><p><strong>JD20c. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.2.11, f. 67v untitled	32</p><p><strong>JD20d. </strong>GB-Lam 602, f. 6v <em>A Galliard by Dowla</em>	33</p><p><strong>JD20ei. </strong>GB-Lam 600 (Browne), f. 10v <em>Dowlands Galliard</em> - bandora	34</p><p><strong>JD20eii. </strong>transcribed for lute	34</p><p><strong>JD39(a). </strong>US-Ws V.b.280, f. 6r <em>Doulands Rounde Battell Galyarde</em>	<em>Lute News</em></p><p><strong>JD39b. </strong>GB-Cu Dd.14.24, f. 36v <em>Dowlands Rounde b galliarde</em> - cittern part	31</p><p><strong>	</strong>GB-Cu Dd.5.20, f. 5r <em>Do: Round Battell galliarde </em>- bass viol part </p><p><strong>	</strong>GB-Cu Dd.5.21, f. 5v <em>Dowlands round Battell galliarde</em> - recorder part</p><p><strong>JD40(a). </strong>US-Ws V.b.280, ff. 10v-11r <em>The Battell Gallyard Mr Dowland</em>	<em>Lute News</em></p><p><strong>JD40b.</strong> LT-Va 285-MF-LXXIX (Königsberg), ff. 22v-23r <em>Galliarda </em></p><p><em>	Anglic Dulandt / Variatio</em>	35</p><p><strong>JD40c. </strong>GB-Lbl Eg.2046 (Pickeringe), ff. 17v-18r <em>the battell galyerd by m<sup>r</sup>. dowlande</em>	36-37</p><p><strong>JD40d.</strong> GB-WPforester welde, f. 5v <em>The Battle Galliard</em>	38-39</p><p><strong>JD40e.</strong> GB-Cu Dd.9.33, f. 23r <em>M<sup>r</sup> Mildmays Galliard J D. </em>continued as</p><p>	GB-Cu Dd.9.33, f. 94v <em>Dowlande plus in prima pa</em>[rte libri]	40-41</p><p><strong>JD40f. </strong>GB-Lam 602 (Sampson), f. 7v <em>The battaile Galliarde by Johnson</em>	42-43</p><p><strong>JD40g.</strong> D-B 40141 (Nauclerus), f. 239r <em>Galliarda Dulandi</em>	43</p><p><strong>JD40h.</strong> Dowland <em>Varietie</em> 1610, sigs.

In a letter of October 11 1572 to her brother Francesco Maria II, Lavinia della Rovere recalls the first two lines of a song 'Madre non mi far monaca, Che non mi voglio fare' suggesting that it was already popular by the 1570s, and in fact the text was known from the fifteenth century but to a different tune than the one here.<sup><a href="#endnote-19" id="endnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> Thirty-five complete settings are edited here, plus incipits for the last four as I have not yet found copies of these sources.<sup><a href="#endnote-20" id="endnote-ref-20">[20]</a></sup> N<sup>o</sup> M26 comes from the defective Modena B manuscript and The Partita 1-3 and all but the final thirteen bars of the B strain repeat of Partita 4 are missing, and a not very satisfactory attempt has been made to reconstruct as much as possible.
